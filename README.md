# Retail_Insights-Transaction_Pattern_Analysis
This project uncovers hidden shopping patterns in retail transactions from the Stationary and Health &amp; Beauty Aids departments. By analyzing 200,000 transactions, we identify frequently bought product combinations, generate insightful association rules, and leverage key metrics like confidence and lift to inspire data-driven retail strategies.
